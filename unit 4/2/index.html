    <ol>
        <li>Create the following variables</li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>name</b>, which is a string set to your current name</li>
            <p>let name = Will</p>

            <li><b>dayOfBirth</b>, which is a number set to the day of your birth month</li>
            <p>let dayOfBirth = 03/23</p>
        </ul>

        <li>See what happens when you have multiple variables of the same name. Which one takes precedence?</li>
        <p>Neither will take precedence, one a variable is declared, it can't be redeclared</p>

        <li>Write some JavaScript that prompt's the user for their favorite color. Once the user has submitted a
            favorite
            color, log that color to the console along with a friendly message.
        </li>
        <br>
        let colorResponse = prompt('what is your favorite color?') <br>
        console.log('Your favorite color is ' + colorResponse)
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Create a string that contains both single quotes and double quotes.</li>
        <p>let sentence = 'creating a string with "double quotes" and single quotes'</p>

        <li>What is the difference between null and undefined?</li>
        <p>Null is an intentional absence of any value and it must be assigned, but undefined are varaibles that do not
            have
            an assigned value and are undefined</p>

        <li>What is <b>NaN</b> in JavaScript? What is the <b>typeof NaN</b>?</li>
        <p>NaN is a number but also not a number</p>

        <li>You can declare a variable by typing <b>let thing</b>; What is the value of <b>thing</b>?</li>
        <p>thing would be the variable, as for what the value of thing is, it would be undefined</p>
    </ol>
